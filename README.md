# ATTENTION: THIS NO LONGER WORKS I AM LEAVING IT UP AS A EXAMPLE OF GRAPHQL REQUESTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# NOTE: QUERY GENERATION STILL WORKS HOWEVER THE GRAPHQL ENDPOINT IS LOCKED DOWN
# OpenSeaQueryGenerator
Generates a query for a collection of your choice.
# Programming language?
Written in Python 3.6.
# Why release this?
I don't need the generator anymore so might as well release the code.
# WARNING:
There is no exception handling as this is just a example i removed my handling for request exceptions and overall code exceptions and this is not the full code from my OpenSea monitor PM me if you want access to that code this is just the query generator
# What is different between this code and your monitors?
Exception handling timeout delays you can set and other arguments cleaner code and a webhook/mutiple collection monitoring along with JSON parsing
